## Note (!!!IMPORTANT!!!)

-This website project is designed on & for monitors with an aspect ratio of 16:9(Usually 1920x1080 or 2560x1440, etc.), which means it may not suit for monitors with other aspect ratio. I've tried my best to do some basic self-adaptive designs.

-Pages may take a while to load up(about 5 seconds) because of hyperlinks
