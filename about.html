            <h2 class="section-subtitle">About the Website</h2><p>(By 3B04 Lai Sheung Yuk)</p>
            <p style="font-size: 16px;">
              This website took me about 12 hours in total to complete it. <br>
              Although I have listened to the lessons in the past lessons, <br>
              I still feel a bit stressful while making this website. <br>
              Since this is my first time making a website using html and css, <br>
              I got confused by the start of my developement in several areas. <br>
              Thankfully, I finally have completed the website. <br>
              I treated this project as my first attempt on frontend developing, <br>
              and I made it <b>By Heart</b>. <br>
              Although There are still some mistakes and difficulties which I tried really hard <br>
              to struggle with but finally failed, I still feel proud of this project. <br><br>
              <b>Please enjoy it.</b>
